Building a QAOA implementation in Jasp
======================================

In this tutorial, we will explain step-by-step how to build a custom QAOA implementation in Jasp for the example of the MaxCut problem.


First, let us recall the problem description for MaxCut:

Given a Graph  :math:`G = (V,E)` find a bipartition $S$, $V\setminus S$ of the set of vertices $V$ such that the number of edges between $S$ and $V\setminus S$ is maximal.

   :scale: 60%
   :align: center

For a graph $G$ with $n$ nodes, such a bipartition can be encoded with a :ref:`QuantumVariable` with $n$ qubits: 
we measure the $i$-th qubit in 0 if the node $i$ is in the set $S$, and 1 if the node $i$ is in the set $V\setminus S$.
The cut value is the number of edges $e=(i,j)$ in $G$ such that $i\in S$ and $j\in V\setminus S$.

In Jasp, varibales are decoded to integers (i.e. jax.numpy.int) and not to binrary strings. In this case, the binary representation of an integer encodes a bipartition of the graph $G$.
Therefore, repeated sampling from a QuantumVariable in a superposition state will result in an array of integers representing bipartitions of the graph $G$. 
Within QAOA, we require a post processing function to compute the average cut value for an array of samples.

As a first step, we will learn how to write a ``post_processor`` that can be compiled using ``jax.jit`` into a highly optimized version using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. 
This can significantly speed up the execution of numerical computations.


Computing the Average Cut of a Graph with JAX
---------------------------------------------

**Step 1: Import Libraries**

First, we need to import the necessary libraries.

::

    import jax.numpy as jnp
    from jax import jit, vmap
    import networkx as nx

    from qrisp import QuantumVariable, h, rx, rzz
    from qrisp.jasp import sample, minimize, jaspify, jrange, make_jaspr


**Step 2: Define the Function to Extract Boolean Digits**

We will define a function that extracts the value of a specific bit (digit) from an integer.

::

    @jit
    def extract_boolean_digit(integer, digit):
        return (integer >> digit) & 1

**Step 3: Create the Cut Computer Function**

The cut computer function calculates the cut value for a given integer representation of a bipartition of a graph. This function will use the edges of the graph to determine how many edges cross the cut.

::

    def create_cut_computer(G):
        edge_list = jnp.array(G.edges())  # Convert edge list to JAX array

        @jit
        def cut_computer(x):
            x_uint = jnp.uint32(x)
            bools = extract_boolean_digit(x_uint, edge_list[:, 0]) != extract_boolean_digit(x_uint, edge_list[:, 1])
            cut = jnp.sum(bools)  # Count the number of edges crossing the cut
            return -cut

        return cut_computer

**Step 4: Create the Sample Array Post Processor**

This function will process an array of samples and compute the average cut using the cut_computer function. It will utilize JAX's vectorization capabilities for efficiency.

::

    def create_sample_array_post_processor(G):
        cut_computer = create_cut_computer(G)

        def post_processor(sample_array):
            # Use vmap for automatic vectorization
            cut_values = vmap(cut_computer)(sample_array)  
            average_cut = jnp.mean(cut_values)  # Directly compute average
            return average_cut

        return post_processor

**Step 5: Example Usage**

Now we can create a graph and use our functions to compute the average cut.

::

    # Create a sample graph
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (1, 3)])

    # Create the post processor function
    post_processor = create_sample_array_post_processor(G)

    # Sample input array representing different cuts
    sample_array = jnp.array([0b0001, 0b0010, 0b0100, 0b1000])  # Example binary representations

    # Compute the average cut
    average_cut = post_processor(sample_array)
    print("Average Cut:", average_cut)


So far, we created a function using JAX to compute the average cut of a graph efficiently. 
We defined a few helper functions, including one for extracting bits and another for calculating cuts, and then used JAX's vectorization capabilities to process multiple samples effectively.


Setting up the QAOA
-------------------

For additional details, we refer to the :ref:`MaxCutQAOA` tutorial.

**Step 6: Define the QAOA ansatz**

First, we will define the the cost operator and mixer.

:: 

    def create_cost_operator(G):

        def apply_cost_operator(qv, gamma):
            for pair in list(G.edges()):
                rzz(gamma, qv[pair[0]], qv[pair[1]])

        return apply_cost_operator


    def apply_mixer(qv, beta):
        rx(beta, qv)

Next, we define the QAOA ansatz that creates a QuantumVariable, brings it into uniform superposition and applies $p$ layers of the parametrized cost operator and mixer.

::

    def create_ansatz(G):

        apply_cost_operator = create_cost_operator(G)

        def ansatz(theta, p):
            qv = QuantumVariable(G.number_of_nodes())

            # Prepare uniform superposition
            h(qv)

            for i in jrange(p):
                apply_cost_operator(qv, theta[i])
                apply_mixer(qv, theta[p+i])

            return qv
    
        return ansatz

**Step 7: Define the Objective Function**

The objective function samples from the parametrized QAOA ansatz and computes the average cut value.

:: 

    def create_objective(G):

        ansatz = create_ansatz(G)
        post_processor = create_sample_array_post_processor(G)

        def objective(theta, p):

            res_sample = sample(ansatz, shots=1000)(theta ,p)

            value = post_processor(res_sample)

            return value
    
        return objective

**Step 8: Use a JAX-traceable Optimization Routine**

We define the qaoa function for finding the optimal parameter values using the JAX-traceable :ref:`minimize <optimization_tools>` routine.
It returns an array of optimal parameters and the average cost value for the optimal solution.

::

    def qaoa():

        # Create a sample graph
        G = nx.Graph()
        G.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (1, 3)])

        ansatz = create_ansatz(G)
        objective = create_objective(G)

        # Number of layers
        p = 3

        # Initial point for theta
        x0 = jnp.array([0.5]*2*p)

        result = minimize(objective,x0,(p,))

        # Sample from ansatz state for optimal parameters
        samples = sample(ansatz, shots = 10)(result.x,p)

        return samples

**Step 9: Run the QAOA**

Finally, the jaspify method allows for running Jasp-traceable functions using the integrated Qrisp simulator.
For hybrid algorithms like QAOA and VQE that rely on calculating expectation values based on sampling, the ``terminal_sampling`` feature significantly speeds up the simulation: samples are drawn from the state vector instead of performing repeated simulation and measurement of the quantum circuits.

::

    jaspify(qaoa, terminal_sampling=True)()


You can also create the :ref:`jaspr` object and compile to `QIR <https://www.qir-alliance.org>`_ using `Catalyst <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/index.html>`_.

::

    jaspr = make_jaspr(qaoa)()
    qir_str = jaspr.to_qir()
