     - enhancing amplitude of a target state
   * - :ref:`Linear Combination of Unitaries <LCU>`
     - implements the prepare-select-unprepare structure (block encoding) for linear combinations of unitaries; used in Hamiltonian simulation (QSP, QSVT, LCHS)  
   * - :ref:`Quantum Amplitude Estimation <QAE>`
     - estimating the amplitude of a target state
   * - :ref:`Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation <IQAE>`
     - resource efficient quantum amplitude estimation
   * - :ref:`Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation <IQPE>`
     - resource efficient quantum phase estimation
   * - :ref:`phase_polynomials` 
     - provides functions for applying diagonal Hamiltonians given by polynomials
   * - :ref:`Grover's Algorithm <grover_tools>`
     - unstructured search
   * - :ref:`Dicke state preparation <DickeStates>`
     - preparation of Dicke states, i.e., states with a given Hamming weight 
   * - Iterable :ref:`Demuxing <ItDemuxing>`, :ref:`Shifting <ItShifting>`, and :ref:`Permutation <ItPermutation>`
     - low-level manipulations of quantum arguments like :ref:`QuantumVariable <QuantumVariable>` or :ref:`QuantumArray <QuantumArray>`
   * - :ref:`Quantum State Preparation <prepare>`
     - prepare a quantum state with given amplitudes
   * - :ref:`Quantum Switch Case <qswitch>`
     - Executes a `switch statement <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement>`_. The condition can be a :ref:`QuantumVariable`.
   * - :ref:`Prefix arithmetic <prefix_arithmetic>`
     - several arithmetic functions that allow better control over precision and output types than the infix version


We encourage you to explore these algorithms, delve into their documentation, and experiment with their implementations.
